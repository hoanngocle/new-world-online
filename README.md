## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `@core`

The @core directory contains theme layout, components, and assets such as Sass files, Vue, images, or fonts.

### `assets`

The new assets directory contains your custom scss, images, or fonts.

### `auth`

The new assets directory contains your custom scss, images, or fonts.
